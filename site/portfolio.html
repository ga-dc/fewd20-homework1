<h1> Experience </h1>
								<hr>
<img src="images/C-Money Portfolio Pic.jpg" height="460" width="400" align="right"/>

<p> I recently graduated from a Front End Web Development Course held by General Assembly. 
I hold a degree in Media & Communication Studies and have attended a Masters program in Media & Film Production at the New School. As a filmmaker who has worked for several media outlets, I have experience managing every aspect of production from coordinating shoots to operating audio and visual equipment.

<p>My media production positions have taught me to work in a fast-paced environment, while simultaneously communicating with show producers, directors, as well as talent (musicians, actors, show hosts). Additionally, I run a small business that provides film and photography services giving me the expert knowledge necessary in communicating with clients and potential business partners, working independently and coordinating various projects. </p>
