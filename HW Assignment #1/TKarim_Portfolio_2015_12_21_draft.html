<h2>Experience
</h2>
				
I recently graduated from a Front-End Web Development course at General Assemblly where I learned HTML, CSS. JavaScript, and jQuery.  During the course, I also dicovered that development has a lot in common with drafting agreements.  Concepts such as version control, structure, clean formatting, and the uutilizind and customizing pre-existing language play a great part in both disciplines.
